	Hey there! I'm Rob. Currently I'm working as a software engineer at <a href="https://etsy.com">Etsy</a>, building seller ad products and marketing tools. My career has walked the line between data science and software engineering, and I'm passionate about both (with a preference for working on projects that combine the two). If you're interested in collaborating and/or want to chat, you can reach me at rforgione (at) gmail (dot) com.
