	Hey there! I'm Rob. Currently I'm working as a software engineer at <a href="https://etsy.com">Etsy</a>, building advertising products and 
	seller marketing tools. Recently my passions have centered around deep learning. I'm also especially interested in researching
  ways to make inferences and insights possible even in the context of "black-box" approaches. If you're interested in collaborating and/or want to chat, 
  you can reach me at rforgione (at) gmail (dot) com.
