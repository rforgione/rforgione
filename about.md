	Hey there! I'm Rob. Currently I'm working with the Analytics team at Etsy, helping them to optimize their advertising products and 
	seller marketing tools. Most recently my passions have centered around deep learning with a focus on computer vision. I'm also especially interested in researching
  ways to make inferences and insights possible even in the context of "black-box" approaches. If you're interested in collaborating and/or just want to 
	chat about data, you can reach me at rforgione (at) gmail (dot) com.
