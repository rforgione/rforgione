Hey there! I'm Rob. I'm a Data Scientist by profession and by hobby. Currently I'm working on the Analytics team at Etsy, where I help them optimize their seller services products. Lately I've been spending a lot of time thinking about deep learning and inference from algorithmic models.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
